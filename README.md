	Custom designed Open-Source Numpad/Macropad
I needed a numpad, more specifically a 10 key pad with Backspace and Tab for work. Now I considered simply settling with remapping a existing numpad in QMK, which of course is totally possible and if you found this because you have this problem... Just do that. it will save you 10s of hours, and alot of money. Or use these files and save the time, but you will likely still end up spending 2-3x the cost of a really nice off the shelf numpad. I might link some here sometime, because unless a few dozen of you decide to put this into GB, it is simply not worth the investment. Thus, contining to read this "Readme" is really not worth your time, or mine to write it, But hey! I'm already this far... (and so are you, so once more go buy a numpad but feel free to see how far this devolves from here.)
