	Custom designed Open-Source Numpad/Macropad
I needed a numpad, more specifically a 10 key pad with Backspace and Tab for work. Now I considered simply settling with remapping a existing numpad in QMK, which of course is totally possible and if you found this because you have this problem... Just do that. it will save you 10s of hours, and alot of money. Or use these files and save the time, but you will likely still end up spending 2-3x the cost of a really nice off the shelf numpad. I might link some here sometime, because unless a few dozen of you decide to put this into GB, it is simply not worth the investment. Thus, contining to read this "Readme" is really not worth your time, or mine to write it, But hey! I'm already this far... (and so are you, so once more go buy a numpad but feel free to see how far this devolves from here.)

	Key Features: 
Optional Top Row Layout: 1.5u Backspace/ 1.5u Tab

Optional Bottom Row ("0, ."): 1.75u Shift/ 1.25u Fn

No Vertical 2u "+" swapped for 2 additional 1u keys

	Future Updates:
 For Absolutly no reason, I have decided I want it to also have the option of adding a OLED/LCD Screen and Wireless functionality (depending on Microcontroller compatability) and so I will be figuring out how to add a battery jack, and 5 pin connector. 
 
 Once I get the first Prototypes from my solder version (see /Custom_Numpad1) I will begin building the firmware.

 Current Plan is to support MOST popular micro controllers, which will require QMK/KMK/and ZMK, I have never done this from scratch so we shall see just how over ambitiuos this is. I have already obtained a Pi Pico (rp2040), Nice!Nano (nRF52840), and Pro Micro (ATmega32U4). 

 Depending on how that goes, I plan to design another PCB with integrated microcontroller, TBD.
